Mel Beall – DA09:
The New South Wales Grazing Study

MOTIVATION

My passion for knitting led me to learn about spinning yarn, growing natural dye plants, wool production, and eventually vegetable and small ruminant farming. After working for years on farms, I became fascinated by the impact of animal grazing on soil health. While herding goats and sheep through pasture, I learned about rotational grazing and witnessed its profound impact on ecological restoration. Through field observation, it was clear that intensive rotational grazing could have a massive impact in soil improvement over time, but free roam grazing would have the opposite effect. My interest in textiles combined with my concern for the climate crisis we are currently living through causes me to turn my attention to grazing and wonder how we can allow the animals we foster to rebuild a healthy living planet. 

THE DATA
	
The New South Wales Grazing Assessment is a large collection of datasets spanning fifty-four grazing sites collected over three years. I looked at four datasets and focused on the measures of soil health below:

Three soil types – silt, sand, clay
Three animals – livestock (goats, sheep, deer, cattle), kangaroo, rabbits
Three measures of soil chemistry – ph, phosphorus, carbon
Three communities – Redgum, Cypress Pine, Blackbox


Data Questions

The goal of my project is to discover key correlations between animal grazing and overall soil quality. While I have personally seen intensive rotational grazing positively impact soil health and biodiversity, I will be curious to see if analysis of certain indicators of soil health may in fact show over-grazing or soil depletion.

My questions: how do we measure soil quality? Which animals are the major grazers? Which plants are the major growers?

Technologies

The four datasets used were retrieved from the website operated by the government of the Australian state New South Wales. The datasets were downloaded as CSV files in Excel where I then used pivot tables to explore the data. For most of the project, I used a Geospatial Conda Environment and Python 3 within a Jupyter Notebook, mainly working within a Folium to visualize the data interactions required for analysis. Finally, I used Tableau to visualize data relationships as represented in my final presentation.

Problems & Hurdles

The data interpretability was fair. There are many data points that are specific to soil science and many terms are not well defined in the ReadMe or MetaData. For example, to utilize soil health data, I had to do some research to understand how texture analysis is obtained before I could evaluate its relevance to my project. I did this research with a lot of the data before knowing what to move forward with in analysis. 

The Data Quality Statement provided indicates it will be necessary to contact the Custodian for the dataset for this information, however, the Custodian was unable to provide me with more information than what was openly accessible. 

SUMMARY
My questions: how do we measure soil quality? Which animals are the major grazers? Which plants are the major growers?

I found that high levels of carbon and phosphorus in the soil were likely predictors of soil health. The amount of dung events shows rabbits to be the animal in highest number present in the dataset. Sheep showed more dung events than cattle, while there were clear locations of pugging out-numbering dung events in certain quadrants. Native grasses are the primary plants growing.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

“The final piece of the carbon cycle is grazing. Most of the biomass in grass, or any other plant, is tied up in complex polymers like cellulose and lignin, which are a stockpile of stored solar energy. This solar power is completely inaccessible to humans, but it is indirectly accessible to cattle. Cattle are part of a group of animals called ruminants, along with sheep and bison that chew the cud regurgitated from their rumen. Rumen is the first stomach of a ruminant, where food or cud is received and partly digested with the aid of bacteria, before passing on to another part of the animal’s digestive tract.”

The Cornell Soil Health Testing Lab uses these indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of soil health:

1.CHEMICAL MAKEUP
pH & phosphorus 

2.BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Organic Matter: Carbon-rich material derived from living organisms
Active Carbon: Organic matter that can serve as a food source for soil microbes

3.PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Soil Texture: Makeup of sand, silt, and clay

FOUR SOIL HEALTH PRINCIPLES
Minimize Disturbance
Maximize Continuous Living Roots
Maximize Biodiversity
Maximize Cover
