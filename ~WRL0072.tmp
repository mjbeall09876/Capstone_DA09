Summary
For my Capstone Project, I will investigate the impact of animal grazing over ten Australian sites over three years. The goal of my project is to discover any correlation between animal grazing (wildlife and/or livestock), carbon sequestration, vegetation type, and overall soil quality. While I have personally seen intensive rotational grazing positively impact soil health and biodiversity, I will be curious to see if the mixture of landscapes represented as well as mix of wild and stock grazing may in fact show over-foraging and soil depletion.
Motivation
My passion for knitting led me to learn about wool production, growing natural dye plants, and eventually vegetable and ruminant farming. It was in the fields where I learned about rotational grazing and witnessed its profound impact on ecological restoration. My interest in textiles combined with my concern for the climate crisis we are currently living through causes me to turn my attention to grazing and wonder how we can allow the animals we foster to rebuild a healthy living planet. 
Data Question
Present your question. Feel free to include any research/articles that are relevant or show where others have attempted to answer this question.

What is the ideal range of grazing diversity (wildlife and animal stock) in the Australian regions studied? Are some regions over grazed or does more intense grazing always correlate to greater soil health? What are acceptable parameters that indicate soil health?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Define your MVP. This should be a description of what your final capstone will look like, including visualizations, how the analysis will be presented, who the intended audience is, etc.

This analysis will present an audience of people unaware of the impact of animal grazing on soil health and biodiversity. I will present the data using a Tableau story or Power BI dashboard in which I will create a map of the covered Australian regions studied. I will include analysis within the map of grazing’s impact on soil health segmented by animal, forage, tracks, chemicals, and animal burrows. 

Schedule
1. Get the Data (09/17/20223)
2. Clean & Explore the Data (09/30/2023)
3. Create Presentation of your Analysis (10/24/2023)
- Should be a presentation, but could include a Jupyter Notebook or dashboard in Excel, Tableau, or PowerBI
4. Internal demos (10/26/2023)
5. Demo Day!! (11/02/2023)

Data Sources
Document the data you use and the source of that data
The NSW Grazing Study | The NSW Grazing Study Site location and details | SEED 
Soil Health Data | The NSW Grazing Study Assessment of Soil Health | SEED
Landscape Resilience Data | Landscape Resilience data | SEED (nsw.gov.au)

Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:
? If you need to request data or an api key
? Based on your data sources, known data cleaning steps

There are some technical terms I will need to read up on to understand what the data is documenting related to chemicals and animal markings. For example: what is soil stability or infiltration and what can it tell us about soil health? The Data Quality Statement provided indicates it will be necessary to contact the Custodian for the dataset for this information. I am also curious how livestock grazing is practiced in these areas.
